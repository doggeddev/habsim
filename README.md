High Altitude Balloon Simulator

Currently this is the start of a high altitude balloon simulator.

Currently:
* Doesn't calculate changing pressure vs altitude (pretty obviously incredibly wrong)
* Assumes constant balloon envelope
* Several other silly things that would happen when you are just starting in on a project.

To do:

* Calculate changing pressure of atmosphere with altitude
* Calculate changing drag due to changing balloon envelope
* Calculate burst altitude from balloon envelope
